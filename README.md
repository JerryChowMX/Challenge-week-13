# E-Commerce Backend

This project aims to provide a backend solution for an e-commerce website using Express.js and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## User Story

As a manager at an internet retail company, I want a backend for my e-commerce website that utilizes the latest technologies so that my company can compete effectively with other e-commerce companies.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given a functional Express.js API, when I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, then I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize.
2. When I enter schema and seed commands, then a development database is created and seeded with test data.
3. When I enter the command to invoke the application, then my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.
4. When I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
5. When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
